                  <h1>Let work together!</h1>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;problems Luwrain is&#160;purposed to&#160;solve are&#160;not restricted by&#160;bounds
                    of&#160;any&#160;particular contry. We&#160;are very interested in collaboration with&#160;partners
                    of&#160;any&#160;kind and looking forward to&#160;various contacts with individual developers,
                    social organizations and businesses.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of&#160;the&#160;important things we are&#160;not able to&#160;do on&#160;our own is
                    a&#160;support of&#160;national standards. How could we add&#160;Chinese, Arabic or Brazilian
                    localization if non of&#160;these languages is our own language? If you&#x27;d like to&#160;extend
                    Luwrain applicability on&#160;your contry you are kindly invited to&#160;participate in&#160;our&#160;project.
                    With your help, by&#160;the&#160;way, we would be&#160;able to&#160;get new experience
                    and gather new feedback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;most desirable result is a&#160;production of&#160;hardware devices bringing Luwrain
                    usable &#x22;out&#160;of&#160;box&#x22;. This aim cannot be&#160;approached without constructive
                    dialogue with&#160;corresponding business companies. To&#160;everybody who is&#160;thinking
                    what we are talking about we give a&#160;notice that usual 10&#x2013;12 inches laptops
                    could be&#160;already considered as&#160;rather close to&#160;suitable and we don&#x27;t
                    know why their appearance with&#160;preinstalled Luwrain is&#160;not&#160;possible. Minor
                    changes in&#160;construction could easily make these devices excellent.

                    Our main offering is our idea of&#160;new approach to&#160;accessible environment. We&#160;strongly
                    convinced that a&#160;system implementing this idea can change the&#160;entire understanding
                    how&#160;blind people interact with PCs. Social organizations which are interested in&#160;making
                    this idea real and in&#160;its distribution over everybody who needs it are&#160;also welcomed
                    for&#160;collaboration. We very need your information support!
                  </p>
