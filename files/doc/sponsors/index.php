                  <h1>Financial support</h1>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;Luwrain project is non-profitable and for&#160;successful &#160; evolution it&#160;needs
                    for&#160;external financial help. Luwrain takes social aims and any&#160;funding could
                    make the&#160;life better for&#160;large groups of&#160;wanting people. There&#160;are
                    several types of&#160;things Luwrain seeks money donations for:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>To&#160;employ additional stuff to&#160;lift development speed</li>
                    <li>
                      To&#160;acquire hardware of&#160;various types to test Luwrain compatibility with, including
                      embedded systems and mobile computers
                    </li>
                    <li>To&#160;participate in&#160;related conferences and exhibitions over the&#160;world</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>New hardware for Luwrain</h2>
                  <p>
                    Linux kernel and Java, which are two&#160;major components of&#160;Luwrain, got good chances
                    for&#160;portability across different architectures. Although general development process
                    is&#160;performed on usual x86 machines, the&#160;compiled environment could be likely
                    launched on&#160;other types of&#160;equipment. The&#160;most interesting hardware is various
                    ARM-computers including embedded systems and mobile gadgets. Both of&#160;them are very
                    important since they are cheap and quite suitable for&#160;purposes Luwrain is created
                    for. General Luwrain UI conception has some valuable perspectives to be&#160;adapted for&#160;nearly
                    any type of&#160;user interaction. We are speaking here mostly about tablet computers which
                    have some noticeable advantages although in&#160;global sense they are&#160;not considered
                    as&#160;most suitable PCs for&#160;blind users.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conferences and exhibitions</h2>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain ideas are&#160;not restricted by&#160;borders of&#160;any particular country and
                    everybody welcomed <a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/partners/');?>">for&#160;cooperation</a>. We believe
                    that in&#160;every part of&#160;the&#160;world there are people sharing with us our aspiration
                    and convinced in&#160;same ideas as we do. usually the&#160;conferences and exhibitions
                    are&#160;used to&#160;find each other but whereas they require significant amount of&#160;money
                    for&#160;travel and participation they remains still inaccessible for us.
                  </p>
