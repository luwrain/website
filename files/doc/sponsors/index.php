                  <h1>Financial support</h1>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;Luwrain project itself is non-profitable and for&#160;successful &#160; evolution
                    it&#160;needs for&#160;external financial help. Any funding can make life better for&#160;large
                    groups of&#160;wanting people as&#160;Luwrain pursuits a&#160;significant number of&#160;social
                    goals. There&#160;are two types of&#160;things Luwrain seeks money donations for:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Various types of&#160;hardware including embedded systems and mobile computers to test
                      Luwrain compatibility with and develop new approaches to&#160;interaction for&#160;blind
                      people.
                    </li>
                    <li>Participation in related conferences and exhibitions over the&#160;world.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>New hardware for Luwrain</h2>
                  <p>
                    Linux kernel and Java, which are two&#160;major components of&#160;Luwrain, got good chances
                    for&#160;portability across different architectures. Although general development process
                    is&#160;performed on usual x86 machines in&#160;most cases prepared environment can be
                    launched also on&#160;other types of&#160;hardware. The&#160;most interesting devices for&#160;our
                    tasks are various ARM-computers including embedded systems and mobile gadgets. Both of&#160;them
                    are very important since they are cheap and quite suitable for&#160;purposes Luwrain is
                    created for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meantime general user interface conception taken in&#160;Luwrain has some valuable perspectives
                    to be&#160;adapted for&#160;other types of&#160;user interaction in&#160;addition to&#160;ideas
                    considered for&#160;implementation initially. We are&#160;talking mostly about tablet computers
                    which have some noticeable advantages although in&#160;global sense they can not be taken
                    as&#160;most suitable PCs for&#160;blind users. Simplicity of&#160;Luwrain objects and
                    rules probably is&#160;able to&#160;make tablets more useful for&#160;blind persons than
                    they are now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All of&#160;these tasks require some research and hardware accessible for&#160;developers
                    for&#160;experiments. In&#160;addition usual popular mobile laptops can be still useful
                    for&#160;testing and building lists of&#160;exact models compatible with Luwrain releases
                    according to&#160;acquired experience conclusions.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Conferences and exhibitions</h2>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain ideas are&#160;not restricted by&#160;borders of&#160;any particular country and
                    everybody welcomed <a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/partners/');?>">for&#160;cooperation</a>. We believe
                    that there are people sharing with us our aspiration and convinced of&#160;same ideas as
                    we do in&#160;every part of&#160;the&#160;world. We&#x27;d like to&#160;find each other
                    but in&#160;most cases conferences and exhibitions usually used for&#160;new contacts
                    establishing remains still inaccessible whereas they require significant amount of&#160;money
                    for&#160;travel and participation. Any&#160;help making that possible would be&#160;definitely
                    appreciated!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have any financing offerings for&#160;our project you can use any option from our
                    <a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/contacts/');?>">contacts</a> page to&#160;discuss them with us. We will
                    wait your help!
                  </p>
