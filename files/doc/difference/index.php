                  <h1>Why is Luwrain different than other accessible solutions?</h1>
                  <p>
                    Current widely popular approach offers usual Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment
                    in&#160;conjunction with additional screen reading software. Screen readers speak every
                    action user does through some Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine. This type of&#160;interaction
                    can be done only by&#160;keyboard and that doesn&#x27;t allow to&#160;work at&#160;the&#160;same
                    speed as&#160;everybody does. There is&#160;no way to&#160;overcome this restriction because
                    GUI is&#160;designed to&#160;be&#160;comfort only with&#160;a&#160;mouse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Roughly speaking, everyday blind people have&#160;to fight with the&#160;environment the&#160;least
                    suitable for&#160;them. And to&#160;b&#160;fair it&#160;is necessary to&#160;mention that
                    this&#160;problem is&#160;totally artificial. GUI has been created by&#160;the&#160;hands
                    of&#160;other people and isn&#x27;t strongly required for&#160;work on&#160;PCs. There
                    can be&#160;other conceptions which likely would be&#160;more fortunate for&#160;accessible
                    interaction.

                  <p>
                    Luwrain offers hybrid approach that uses GUI only for&#160;very specific tasks like web-browsing.
                    Surfing over the&#160;web is&#160;nearly impossible with anything else than traditional
                    browsing software, but all other tasks could be reconsidered. The&#160;another idea Luwrain
                    is&#160;developing for is a&#160;text-based interface that invites user into the&#160;friendly
                    environment without any items potentially inaccessible within it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In&#160;new environment the&#160;application decide by&#160;themselves what information
                    provide in&#160;speech form and what information print on&#160;the&#160;screen. Entire
                    screen is&#160;filled with well-readable content relevant to&#160;user active data. Special
                    algorithm decides what part of data should be&#160;printed and how it&#160;should be located.
                    For&#160;visually impaired persons Luwrain offers set of&#160;system-wide settings to&#160;get
                    individual font size, colors etc.

                  <p>
                    Any text-based systems are not a&#160;revelation in&#160;area of&#160;accessibility research,
                    but Luwrain looks for&#160;design that could be&#160;functionally equal to&#160;GUI and
                    save common integrity to&#160;be&#160;convenient for&#160;application developers. It&#x27;s
                    rather difficult task, but we sure it&#160;is&#160;possible.
