                <h1>Why is LUWRAIN different than other accessible solutions?</h1>
                <p>
                  We consider three projects as&#160;something close to&#160;the&#160;things we are creating.
                  They are <a target="_blank" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/">Emacspeak</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-adriane/index-en.html">Adriane</a>
                  and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdolphin.com/productdetail.asp?id=30">Dolphin
                  Guide</a>. LUWRAIN has noticeable differences with all&#160;of&#160;them and let take a&#160;closer
                  look what these difference are.
                </p>
                <h2>Emacspeak</h2>
                <p>
                  Emacspeak can be fairly taken as&#160;an&#160;origin of&#160;our inspiration. A&#160;lot
                  of&#160;ideas came exactly from&#160;Emacspeak but significant number of&#160;its disadvantages
                  don&#x27;t allow to use it as&#160;a&#160;main-stream platform for&#160;blind people (we&#160;think
                  that Emacspeak&#x27;s authors didn&#x27;t plan it to&#160;be anything like this). There&#160;is&#160;a&#160;list
                  of&#160;main points why Emacspeak doesn&#x27;t suit:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Emacspeak doesn&#x27;t have a&#160;proper entity of&#160;application and we may not use
                    it as&#160;a&#160;platform for&#160;creating and distributing of&#160;accessible applications
                  </li>
                  <li>Emacspeak doesn&#x27;t have any i18n support</li>
                  <li>
                    GNU&#160;Emacs basically is a&#160;text editor and it isn&#x27;t a&#160;platform which
                    constructed for&#160;blind people completely
                  </li>
                  <li>Emacspeak doesn&#x27;t have enough protection agains improper user actions</li>
                  <li>
                    Although GNU&#160;Emacs itself is a&#160;cross-platform software, Emacspeak purposed typically
                    for&#160;launch on&#160;GNU/Linux
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Adriane</h2>
                <p>Adriane is a&#160;very interesting experience but has some substantial disadvantages as&#160;well:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Adriane is&#160;a&#160;GNU/Linux distro but we need an&#160;environment capable of&#160;running
                    on&#160;systems different than GNU/Linux
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Adriane may not be used as&#160;a&#160;platform for&#160;creating and distributing accessible
                    applications because doesn&#x27;t have any API for&#160;it
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We don&#x27;t know how to&#160;enhance Adriane and how to&#160;add a&#160;proper i18n support
                    to it
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Dolphin Guide</h2>
                <p>
                  The&#160;main problem with&#160;Dolphin Guide is that it is a&#160;proprietary software.
                  It is proprietary itself and can be launch only on&#160;Microsoft Windows, which is proprietary
                  as&#160;well. Some of&#160;the&#160;disadvantages mentioned for&#160;Emacspeak and for&#160;Adriane
                  are actual for&#160;Dolphin&#160;Guide too but we don&#x27;t list them once again because
                  the&#160;main reason of&#160;rejecting Dolphin Guide is its legal status.
                </p>
                <h2>Other approaches</h2>
                <p>
                  The&#160;most popular solution to&#160;the&#160;problem of&#160;accessible work on&#160;PC
                  remains using of&#160;screen reading software in&#160;GUI. Since difference with this approach
                  is widely analyzed on&#160;other pages of&#160;this website, let skip it here and notice
                  one more important thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we&#160;think, there is no&#160;any solution in&#160;the&#160;world which can be used
                  for&#160;creating a&#160;fully functional device for&#160;blind people. We are speaking
                  not about creating a&#160;new device from&#160;scratch, what evidently is very expensive,
                  but about a&#160;way for&#160;turning existing laptops and embedded PC&#x27;s into elegant
                  and reliable accessory for&#160;blind people.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We need a&#160;completely new way of&#160;interaction and a&#160;completely new way for&#160;offering
                  the&#160;information to&#160;the&#160;user. The&#160;former thing is&#160;needed because
                  we should have a&#160;method for&#160;using touch pads and LUWRAIN is quite suitable for&#160;adding
                  a&#160;support of&#160;interaction with touch pads . The&#160;second thing is needed because
                  all laptops have a&#160;screen and it should be used for&#160;people with low vision. LUWRAIN
                  potentially has all of&#160;this and keeping the&#160;developing of&#160;this ideas we
                  could be able to&#160;adjust a&#160;lot&#160;of hardware for&#160;using by&#160;blind people,
                  including tablets. According to&#160;our experience, none of&#160;the existing solutions
                  can be suitable to this.
