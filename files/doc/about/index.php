                  <h1>About the project</h1>
                  <h2>What are we working on?</h2>
                  <p>
                    First of&#160;all, Luwrain is a&#160;Linux-based specialized OS in&#160;conjunction with
                    intention to&#160;discover new ways for&#160;interaction with&#160;PCs for&#160;blind people.
                    Why Linux? Linux grew&#160;up from a&#160;amateurish experiment to&#160;a&#160;serious
                    platform suitable for&#160;creating the&#160;cutting-edge technologies. Android, Tizen
                    and FirefoxOS nicely proved that it&#160;is really the&#160;case. Thinking about their
                    success, we&#x27;d like to&#160;consider the&#160;current time as&#160;a&#160;very fortunate
                    moment to&#160;find new&#160;solutions to&#160;various problems in&#160;area of&#160;assistive
                    technologies. Meantime, Luwrain has one very important difference from other&#160;platforms
                    for&#160;gadgets and mobile computers: the&#160;gadgets in&#160;collective consciousness,
                    unfortunately, very often are&#160;considered as&#160;not&#160;more than curious toys,
                    while there are no&#160;doubts that for&#160;disable persons they become truely irreplaceable
                    tools. That obligates us to&#160;constantly remember that we should keep our&#160;project
                    as&#160;a&#160;thing, which may not accept any&#160;influence of&#160;the&#160;entertainment
                    ideas.
                  </p>
                  <p>We gathered our&#160;project philosophy in&#160;following ten brief statements:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It is an OS completely designed for the&#160;blind and visually impaired persons</li>
                    <li>It must be convenient, fast and clearly understandable</li>
                    <li>It&#160;has&#160;to support various languages and localizations</li>
                    <li>It aims to be&#160;sutable for&#160;desktop computers as&#160;well&#160;as for mobile devices</li>
                    <li>It is&#160;based on&#160;the&#160;Linux kernel and other FOSS software</li>
                    <li>No bias towards any particular hardware type</li>
                    <li>It&#160;is a&#160;non-profitable project</li>
                    <li>
                      Its auditory is all users who need it; no&#160;matter what experience they got, what country
                      are they from, what profession are they occupied&#160;in and so&#160;on
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Everybody is&#160;able to&#160;participate in&#160;its development, but authors urge everybody
                      to&#160;respect the&#160;accepted quality requirements for&#160;all incoming patches
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We believe available experience in&#160;GNU/Linux world is&#160;enough at&#160;least to&#160;start
                      this work
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;following additional sections are also useful for&#160;overhaul understanding
                    what Luwrain is:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/difference/');?>">Why is Luwrain different than other accessible solutions?</a></li>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/authors/');?>">Who are the&#160;authors of&#160;the&#160;Luwrain?</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>But it should be nice!</h2>
                  <p>
                    By&#160;the&#160;way we would like to notice that Luwrain does not want to&#160;be&#160;a&#160;prosaic
                    project. We have&#160;to&#160;do&#160;everything possible to&#160;make it&#160;intriguing
                    and attractive. In&#160;pursuit of&#160;that aim any&#160;ideas how&#160;to&#160;improve
                    user impressions, how&#160;to&#160;make the&#160;usage easier or how&#160;to&#160;eliminate
                    one more boring and time consuming thing would be definitely appreciated here. And There
                    is no any contradiction with the statements above that Luwrain should not pursuit any&#160;entertainment
                    purposes, making your work pleasurable and comfortable isn&#x27;t the&#160;same as&#160;doing
                    funny and pointless things. The&#160;Luwrain consumers just should forget that they are
                    using any kind of&#160;accessibility technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In&#160;this sense Luwrain is rather specific because it&#160;has this intention being
                    a&#160;non-commercial product, and that has a&#160;corresponding explanation. All&#160;commercial
                    products can end if the&#160;company which has originated them lost an&#160;interest or
                    eventually realized that it is not so profitable as it wanted initially. It is a&#160;really
                    serious problem because with&#160;these circumstances a&#160;lot of users can be left without
                    a&#160;tool they really need. In&#160;case of&#160;opened project everybody is&#160;able
                    to&#160;continue the&#160;work if&#160;he thinks it&#160;worth it.
                  </p>
                  <h2>The&#160;research part</h2>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;another important part of&#160;the&#160;Luwrain idea is an&#160;acceptance of&#160;results
                    given by&#160;modern scientific research in&#160;relevant areas. The&#160;world of&#160;information
                    technologies is not frozen, it&#160;changes permanently and Luwrain should reflect that
                    properly. Thus everybody can feel himself completely free to&#160;propose new ideas if
                    that does not violate ten terms stated above.
                  </p>
                  <h2>By the author</h2>
                  <p>
                    At&#160;the end of&#160;this little free story what Luwrain is, I&#x27;d like to write
                    a&#160;few words as&#160;some kind of&#160;personal notes. I had&#160;to use screen reading
                    software since 2001 and never from that moment was satisfied by&#160;tools I&#160;got.
                    The&#160;closest package to&#160;my&#160;understanding what is the&#160;most suitable software
                    for&#160;blind users is <a target="_blank" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">emacspeak</a>,
                    but none of&#160;my previous attempts to&#160;help other people improve their lifes using
                    emacspeak was successful. After precise analysis what the&#160;problems are, Luwrain has
                    been created and all its ideas are exactly the&#160;conclusions of&#160;this&#160;analysis.
                    Anyway, I am very grateful to&#160;all emacspeak authors because the&#160;results of&#160;their
                    work gave me a&#160;reliable tool and a&#160;lot of&#160;useful thoughts!
                  </p>
                  <p>With the&#160;warmest wishes, Michael Pozhidaev.</p>
