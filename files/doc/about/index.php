                  <h1>About the project</h1>
                  <h2>What are we working on?</h2>
                  <p>
                    First of&#160;all, Luwrain is an&#160;operating system with an attempt to&#160;apply some
                    new ideas and any available experience in&#160;area of&#160;OS design for&#160;needs of&#160;blind
                    persons. Current time to do this work is very fortunate as Android, Tizen and FirefoxOS
                    made it easy to&#160;realize that Linux turned&#160;out as&#160;a&#160;wonderful base for&#160;popular
                    devices and in&#160;same time it&#160;remains publicly available for&#160;using by&#160;everybody.
                    Once you got proper understanding of&#160;LInux world you get a&#160;clew what you should
                    do if you&#x27;d like to&#160;create cutting-edge technology. We&#x27;d like to&#160;treat
                    that fact as&#160;a&#160;good chance for&#160;solution of&#160;rather difficult problems
                    in&#160;area of&#160;assistive technologies as we never had before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meantime one important thing should be clarified especially detailly. a&#160;lot of&#160;usual
                    gadgets based on popular mobile OS like Android or something like that very often eventually
                    are&#160;considered by&#160;their users as&#160;not&#160;more valuable than some sort of&#160;modern
                    toys. In case of assistive technologies any doubts what exactly devices&#160;are: an&#160;irreplaceable
                    tool or an&#160;item for&#160;entertainment, are completely improper. They are always the&#160;former
                    because disabled persons are not&#160;able to&#160;do&#160;without them. Such helpful things
                    are not able to become boring and users will not give&#160;up them.
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, we guess we&#160;are able to&#160;describe the&#160;project philosophy precisely with the&#160;following 10 brief statements:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It is an OS completely designed for blind and visually impaired persons.</li>
                    <li>It must be convenient, fast and clearly understandable.</li>
                    <li>It&#160;has&#160;to support various languages and localizations.</li>
                    <li>It aims to be&#160;sutable for&#160;desktop computers as&#160;well&#160;as for mobile work.</li>
                    <li>It is&#160;based on&#160;the&#160;Linux kernel and other FOSS software.</li>
                    <li>No any bias towards any particular hardware type.</li>
                    <li>It&#160;is non-profitable project.</li>
                    <li>
                      Its auditory is all users who need it. No&#160;matter what experience they got, what country
                      are they from, what profession are they occupied&#160;in and so&#160;on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Everybody is&#160;able to&#160;participate in&#160;its development. but authors want to&#160;keep
                      high quality and urge everybody to&#160;respect accepted quality requirements for&#160;all
                      incoming patches.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We believe available experience in&#160;GNU/Linux world is&#160;enough at&#160;least to&#160;start
                      this work and gives good base for&#160;success.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;following additional sections of&#160;this website can be also useful for&#160;overhaul
                    understanding what Luwrain is:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/devel/design');?>">Exact technical design details of the&#160;Luwrain distribution.</a></li>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/authors/');?>">Who are the&#160;authors of&#160;the&#160;Luwrain project?</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>But it should be nice!</h2>
                  <p>
                    By&#160;the&#160;way we would like to notice that Luwrain does not want to&#160;be&#160;an&#160;ordinary
                    project. We have&#160;to&#160;do&#160;everything possible to&#160;make it&#160;interesting
                    and attractive. In&#160;pursuit of&#160;that aim any&#160;ideas how&#160;to&#160;improve
                    user impressions, how&#160;to&#160;make usage easier or how&#160;to&#160;eliminate one
                    more boring and time consuming thing will be definitely appreciated here. If once Luwrain
                    users fill themselves using something that is not a&#160;accessibility technology anymore
                    we&#x27;d like to&#160;treat such moment as&#160;a&#160;real success making Luwrain itself
                    something very close to a&#160;state of&#160;the&#160;art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain is specific in&#160;this sense as&#160;it has such intention being not a&#160;commercial
                    product. That has corresponding explanation: commercial companies always are not free from
                    the&#160;one serious problem: all products they originate usually die at&#160;the&#160;moment
                    of their fault or at&#160;the moment when their products do not yield gain any more. It
                    is a&#160;really serious problem because in&#160;these circumstances a&#160;lot of users
                    can be left without a&#160;tool they really need.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Research part</h2>
                  <p>
                    Another important part of&#160;Luwrain idea is an&#160;acceptance of&#160;results given
                    by&#160;modern scientific research in&#160;relevant areas if there are any. The&#160;world
                    of&#160;information technologies is not frozen. It&#160;changes permanently and Luwrain
                    should reflect such changes properly. So everybody can fill himself completely free to&#160;propose
                    new ideas to&#160;Luwrain for&#160;experimental implementation if that does not violate
                    ten terms stated at&#160;the&#160;top of this page.
                  </p>
                  <h2>By the author</h2>
                  <p>
                    At&#160;the end of&#160;this free story what Luwrain is I&#x27;d like to write a&#160;few
                    words as&#160;some kind of&#160;personal notes. I have&#160;to use screen reading software
                    since 2001 and never from that moment was satisfied by&#160;tools I&#160;got. The&#160;closest
                    package to&#160;my&#160;understanding what is the&#160;most suitable software for&#160;blind
                    users is <a target="_blank" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">emacspeak</a>. But
                    none of&#160;my previous attempts to&#160;help other people improve their lifes using emacspeak
                    was successful. After precise analysis what are the&#160;problems Luwrain was created and
                    all of&#160;Luwrain ideas are exactly conclusions of&#160;my&#160;analysis. Anyway I am
                    very grateful to&#160;all emacspeak authors because the&#160;results of&#160;their work
                    give me reliable tool and a&#160;lot of&#160;ideas!
                  </p>
                  <p>With the&#160;warmest wishes, Michael Pozhidaev.</p>
