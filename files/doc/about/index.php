                  <h1>About the project</h1>
                  <h2>What are we working on?</h2>
                  <p>
                    First of&#160;all, Luwrain is a&#160;Linux-based specialized OS and a&#160;place to&#160;apply
                    any new ideas and experience. Linux grew&#160;up from a&#160;amateurish experiment to&#160;a&#160;serious
                    platform, suitable for&#160;creating cutting-edge technologies. Android, Tizen and FirefoxOS
                    nicely proved that it&#160;is really so. Thinking about their success, we&#x27;d like to&#160;consider
                    the&#160;current time as&#160;a&#160;very fortunate moment for&#160;an&#160;attempt to&#160;solve
                    various problems in&#160;area of&#160;assistive technologies. One important thing gives
                    there a&#160;significant difference between our work and the&#160;platforms mentioned above.
                    The&#160;usual gadgets, unfortunately, are sometimes considered as&#160;curious toys, not&#160;more,
                    while there are no&#160;doubts whether the&#160;devices with&#160;accessible OS are an&#160;irreplaceable
                    tool or an&#160;item just for&#160;entertainment. They are always the&#160;former as disabled
                    persons are not&#160;able to&#160;do&#160;without them.
                  </p>
                  <p>We gathered our&#160;project philosophy in&#160;following ten brief statements:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It is an OS completely designed for blind and visually impaired persons</li>
                    <li>It must be convenient, fast and clearly understandable</li>
                    <li>It&#160;has&#160;to support various languages and localizations</li>
                    <li>It aims to be&#160;sutable for&#160;desktop computers as&#160;well&#160;as for mobile devices</li>
                    <li>It is&#160;based on&#160;the&#160;Linux kernel and other FOSS software</li>
                    <li>No bias towards any particular hardware type</li>
                    <li>It&#160;is a&#160;non-profitable project</li>
                    <li>
                      Its auditory is all users who need it; no&#160;matter what experience they got, what country
                      are they from, what profession are they occupied&#160;in and so&#160;on
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Everybody is&#160;able to&#160;participate in&#160;its development, but authors urge everybody
                      to&#160;respect the&#160;accepted quality requirements for&#160;all incoming patches
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We believe available experience in&#160;GNU/Linux world is&#160;enough at&#160;least to&#160;start
                      this work
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;following additional sections are useful for&#160;overhaul understanding what
                    Luwrain is:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/difference/');?>">Why is Luwrain different than other accessible solutions?</a></li>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/authors/');?>">Who are the&#160;authors of&#160;the&#160;Luwrain?</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>But it should be nice!</h2>
                  <p>
                    By&#160;the&#160;way we would like to notice that Luwrain does not want to&#160;be&#160;an&#160;prosaic
                    project. We have&#160;to&#160;do&#160;everything possible to&#160;make it&#160;intriguing
                    and attractive. In&#160;pursuit of&#160;that aim any&#160;ideas how&#160;to&#160;improve
                    user impressions, how&#160;to&#160;make usage easier or how&#160;to&#160;eliminate one
                    more boring and time consuming thing would be definitely appreciated here. The&#160;Luwrain
                    consumers should forget that they are using any kind of&#160;accessibility technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain is rather specific in&#160;this sense as&#160;it has this intention being not a&#160;commercial
                    product and that has a&#160;corresponding explanation. All&#160;commercial products can
                    end if the&#160;company, which has originated them, lost an&#160;interest or eventually
                    realized that it is not so profitable as it wanted initially. It is a&#160;really serious
                    problem because with&#160;these circumstances a&#160;lot of users can be left without a&#160;tool
                    they really need. In&#160;case of&#160;opened project everybody is&#160;able to&#160;continue
                    the&#160;work if&#160;he thinks it&#160;worth it.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Research part</h2>
                  <p>
                    Another important part of&#160;Luwrain idea is an&#160;acceptance of&#160;results given
                    by&#160;modern scientific research in&#160;relevant areas. The&#160;world of&#160;information
                    technologies is not frozen, it&#160;changes permanently and Luwrain should reflect that
                    properly. Thus everybody can feel himself completely free to&#160;propose new ideas if
                    that does not violate ten terms stated above.
                  </p>
                  <h2>By the author</h2>
                  <p>
                    At&#160;the end of&#160;this free story what Luwrain is, I&#x27;d like to write a&#160;few
                    words as&#160;some kind of&#160;personal notes. I had&#160;to use screen reading software
                    since 2001 and never from that moment was satisfied by&#160;tools I&#160;got. The&#160;closest
                    package to&#160;my&#160;understanding, what is the&#160;most suitable software for&#160;blind
                    users, is <a target="_blank" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">emacspeak</a>, but
                    none of&#160;my previous attempts to&#160;help other people improve their lifes using emacspeak
                    was successful. After precise analysis what the&#160;problems are, Luwrain has been created
                    and all its ideas are exactly the&#160;conclusions of&#160;this&#160;analysis. Anyway,
                    I am very grateful to&#160;all emacspeak authors because the&#160;results of&#160;their
                    work gave me reliable tool and a&#160;lot of&#160;useful thoughts!
                  </p>
                  <p>With the&#160;warmest wishes, Michael Pozhidaev.</p>
