                  <h1>About the project</h1>
                  <h2>What are we working on?</h2>
                  <p>
                    First of&#160;all, Luwrain is a&#160;specialized OS and a&#160;place to&#160;apply any
                    new ideas and experience. Android, Tizen and FirefoxOS show that Linux turned&#160;out
                    as&#160;a&#160;wonderful base for&#160;popular devices, so current time to do this work
                    is very fortunate. Once you get a&#160;proper understanding of&#160;LInux world you get
                    a&#160;clew what you should do if you&#x27;d like to&#160;create new&#160;cutting-edge
                    technology. We sure it&#160;is a&#160;chance as&#160;we never had before to&#160;solve
                    rather difficult problems in&#160;area of&#160;assistive technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meantime, one important thing should have additional clarification. a&#160;lot of&#160;usual
                    gadgets often eventually considered as&#160;not&#160;more valuable as&#160;toys. In case
                    of assistive technologies any doubts what exactly devices&#160;are, an&#160;irreplaceable
                    tool or an&#160;item for&#160;entertainment, are completely improper. They are always the&#160;former
                    as disabled persons are not&#160;able to&#160;do&#160;without them.
                  </p>
                  <p>We gathered our&#160;project philosophy in&#160;following ten brief statements:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It is an OS completely designed for blind and visually impaired persons</li>
                    <li>It must be convenient, fast and clearly understandable</li>
                    <li>It&#160;has&#160;to support various languages and localizations</li>
                    <li>It aims to be&#160;sutable for&#160;desktop computers as&#160;well&#160;as for mobile devices</li>
                    <li>It is&#160;based on&#160;the&#160;Linux kernel and other FOSS software</li>
                    <li>No bias towards any particular hardware type</li>
                    <li>It&#160;is a&#160;non-profitable project</li>
                    <li>
                      Its auditory is all users who need it; no&#160;matter what experience they got, what country
                      are they from, what profession are they occupied&#160;in and so&#160;on
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Everybody is&#160;able to&#160;participate in&#160;its development, but authors urge everybody
                      to&#160;respect accepted quality requirements for&#160;all incoming patches
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      We believe available experience in&#160;GNU/Linux world is&#160;enough at&#160;least to&#160;start
                      this work and gives good base for&#160;success
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    The&#160;following additional sections of&#160;this website can be useful for&#160;overhaul
                    understanding what Luwrain is:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/devel/design');?>">Exact technical design details of the&#160;Luwrain distribution</a></li>
                    <li><a href="<?echo luwrain_link('/doc/authors/');?>">Who are the&#160;authors of&#160;the&#160;Luwrain project?</a></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>But it should be nice!</h2>
                  <p>
                    By&#160;the&#160;way we would like to notice that Luwrain does not want to&#160;be&#160;an&#160;ordinary
                    project. We have&#160;to&#160;do&#160;everything possible to&#160;make it&#160;intriguing
                    and attractive. In&#160;pursuit of&#160;that aim any&#160;ideas how&#160;to&#160;improve
                    user impressions, how&#160;to&#160;make usage easier or how&#160;to&#160;eliminate one
                    more boring and time consuming thing would be definitely appreciated here. If Luwrain consumers
                    once would be&#160;able to fill themselves using something that actually is not a&#160;accessibility
                    technology, we could treat this moment as&#160;a&#160;real success making Luwrain itself
                    very close to a&#160;state of&#160;the&#160;art.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain is rather specific in&#160;this sense as&#160;it has such intention being not a&#160;commercial
                    product and that has corresponding explanation: commercial companies always are not free
                    from the&#160;one serious problem: all products they originate usually die at&#160;the&#160;moment
                    of their fault or at&#160;the moment when their products do not yield gain any more. It
                    is a&#160;really serious problem because with&#160;these circumstances a&#160;lot of users
                    can be left without a&#160;tool they really need.
                  </p>
                  <h2>Research part</h2>
                  <p>
                    Another important part of&#160;Luwrain idea is an&#160;acceptance of&#160;results given
                    by&#160;modern scientific research in&#160;relevant areas. The&#160;world of&#160;information
                    technologies is not frozen, it&#160;changes permanently and Luwrain should reflect that
                    properly. Thus everybody can fill himself completely free to&#160;propose new ideas if
                    that does not violate ten terms stated above.
                  </p>
                  <h2>By the author</h2>
                  <p>
                    At&#160;the end of&#160;this free story what Luwrain is, I&#x27;d like to write a&#160;few
                    words as&#160;some kind of&#160;personal notes. I had&#160;to use screen reading software
                    since 2001 and never from that moment was satisfied by&#160;tools I&#160;got. The&#160;closest
                    package to&#160;my&#160;understanding what is the&#160;most suitable software for&#160;blind
                    users is <a target="_blank" href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net">emacspeak</a>, but
                    none of&#160;my previous attempts to&#160;help other people improve their lifes using emacspeak
                    was successful. After precise analysis what the&#160;problems are, Luwrain has been created
                    and allits ideas are exactly the&#160;conclusions of&#160;my&#160;analysis. Anyway, I am
                    very grateful to&#160;all emacspeak authors because the&#160;results of&#160;their work
                    gave me reliable tool and a&#160;lot of&#160;useful thoughts!
                  </p>
                  <p>With the&#160;warmest wishes, Michael Pozhidaev.</p>
