                  <h1>About the project</h1>
                  <h2>What are we working on?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Luwrain is an operating system trying to apply some new ideas and any available experience
                    in area of OS design for needs of blind persons. We guess it is possible to precisely describe
                    the project philosophy with the following brief statements:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>It is an OS completely designed for blind persons.</li>
                    <li>
                      Its auditory is all users who need it, no matter what experience they have, what country
                      are they from, what profession are they occupiedd in and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>First of all it must be convenient, fast and clearly understandable.</li>
                    <li>It uses Linux kernel and other FOSS software.</li>
                    <li>It aims to be sutable for mobile work as well for desktop computers.</li>
                    <li>It is non-profitable project.</li>
                    <li>
                      Everybody is able to participate in its development. but authors want to keep high quality
                      and urge everybody to respect quality requirements for all incoming patches.
                    </li>
                    <li>There No any bias towards any exact hardware type.</li>
                    <li>
                      We believe available experience in GNU/Linux world is enough at least to start this work
                      and gives good base for success.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Current time to do this work is very fortunate as Android, Tizen and FirefoxOS make it
                    easy to realize that Linux turned out as wonderful base for interesting devices and
                    in same time it is available for everybody. It is clear what you should do to create cutting-edge
                    technology if you have proper understanding of LInux world. We would like to treat that
                    fact as a good chance for solution of rather difficult problems as we never had before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Meantime a lot of modern gadgets can be considered widely not more than just toys and it
                    turns out especially obvious amid epoch of financial crisis. People learn to distinguish
                    the things that they really need and the things servicing them mostly for entertainment.
                    In case of accessibility technologies any discussions what is it: a irreplaceable tool
                    or an luxury item, are completely improper. There it is always the former.
                  </p>
