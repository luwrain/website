--- Am I allowed to automatically parse duckduckgo search results?

--- sorry. We do not have the rights from our sources to let anyone do that.
We do have an API for instant answers (https://api.duckduckgo.com), but it does not serve normal results.

--- For personal/non-commercial usage too?

--- Yes, afraid so.
What did you want to do?

--- Implement client-side search personalization tool. Got an algorithm that reranks search results based on
personal search history; at the moment I'm looking for search result sources to test it.

--- __Ah. Feel free to run userscripts on the site, if that works for you.__
Beyond that, check out http://commoncrawl.org/ and http://yacy.net/
