                                                                                      [Archiveteam]         
Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue
archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history
and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into
a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business
that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original
point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by
duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight
gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the
data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of
user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various
projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the
generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as
well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are
seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise,
you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as
emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly
lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler
ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred
thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a
WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or
other archive sites).

To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing
it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The
dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at http://www.archivebot.com.

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot.

Nope; sorry. We do not have the rights from our sources to let anyone do that.
We do have an API for instant answers (https://api.duckduckgo.com), but it does not serve normal results.

For personal/non-commercial usage too?

Yes, afraid so.
What did you want to do?

Implement client-side search personalization tool. Got an algorithm that reranks search results based on
personal search history; at the moment I'm looking for search result sources to test it.

Ah. Feel free to run userscripts on the site, if that works for you. Beyond that, check out 
http://commoncrawl.org/ and http://yacy.net/
