With accessible environment Luwrain blind and visually-impaired persons get one more 
way to be involved in the incredible  world of information technologies.
Luwrain doesn't take a lot of time to study and aims to be useful on  laptops as well as on usual desktop computers.
You can treat our new idea as one more solution 
for everybody who needs reliable and accessible companion for various types of work.
The product is designed as new platform for creating speech-enabled applications 
with set of standard tools for easy web access, mail and news reading , etc.

Luwrain is a linux-based system with special type of user interface constructed on Java technologies.
In contrast with widely popular screen reading solutions for graphical desktops 
which actually were designed for control basically by mouse and other pointing devices,
Luwrain follows special conception 
offering representation  of every working object from scratch in text form.
That means in Luwrain user will always spend significantly less time 
than in an adapted GUI.
We have created our environment for people with active style of life 
who appreciate  time economy getting their job done.

In Luwrain  Java user space gathers together a number of system services 
taken for providing flexible core  and good level of compatibility.
Information exchanging between them is performed mostly through  D-Bus activity. 
It brings to a user information about network structure 
from Network Manager
and transmits commands to speech server purposed for Text-To-Speech engines manipulating.
Personal user data can be stored in OpenLDAP
or in any choice of SQL server which has proper JDBC interface.
For low-vision users Luwrain opens full-screen window 
with all corresponding textual data written in  contrast colours.
That window is drawn by X.org server using special window manager 
created as a part of Luwrain project.

Luwrain is a completely Free Software project, no fee is implied,
no restrictions of using and distribution are present, 
except of cases explicitly violating  the terms of GNU Public License ver. 3 
as it was published by Free Software Foundation.
However, money donations are still required to help us
