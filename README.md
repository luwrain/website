The pages of [luwrain.org](http://luwrain.org/?lang=en) are saved as Markdown files
with internal dividing onto several sections for various languages.
The sources are gathered in the [texts/](https://github.com/luwrain/website/blob/master/texts/) directory.
After the processing  by the scripts they are translated to PHP files in  the [files/](https://github.com/luwrain/website/blob/master/files/) directory.
Although the most of files in this directory are autogenerated, wekeep them in the repo anyway to be able to upload them to the server without full reconstruction.
