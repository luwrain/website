# Website materials

The pages of [luwrain.org](http://luwrain.org/?lang=en) are written as Markdown files
divided onto several sections for various languages with a header.
The sources files are gathered in the [texts/](https://github.com/luwrain/website/blob/master/texts/) directory.
After processing  by the scripts the sources are translated to PHP files in  the [files/](https://github.com/luwrain/website/blob/master/files/) directory.
Although the most of files in this directory are autogenerated, w ekeep them in the repo as well
to be able upload them to the server without full reconstruction.

This repository is a part of the LUWRAIN project.
LUWRAIN is a platform for the creation of apps for the blind and partially-sighted.
